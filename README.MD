## You create kebabs at the Pink Elephant store

### 1.) Create your first Kebab 
Nothing inside, you can just call a `description` function which should return the `I am an empty kebab` string. 

### 2.) Add bread
We can call an `add_bread` function, and then the `description` function should return the `I am an empty bread only kebab, please help!` string.

### 3.) Add salad, tomatoes, onions, meat
We can add these ingredients, and an `is_vegetarian` function can say us if it is ok for vegetarian people or not.

### 4.) We should also be pesceterian ready!
We can add fish or shrimps, and in this case an `is_pesceterian` function can say us if it is ok for pesceterian people or not.

### 5.) Protect the kebab from modification, use a box to keep it!
We'll introduce the Builder pattern... to protect our kebab from any damage once it is created :)
